        <p>
          At the Scrolling Societies Lab (within McGill’s Critical Media Lab), I
          served as a research assistant on a multimodal study examining how
          college students engage with TikTok’s seemingly infinite feeds. I
          helped design and implement an experimental research setting that
          brings participants and researchers together in collective
          feed-analysis sessions,
          <strong
            >combining affective computing, eye-tracking data, participant
            journaling, and free-associative image-work</strong
          >
          grounded in participants’ recorded TikTok feeds.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the only member of the research team with a computer science
          background, I contributed technical expertise to the design of data
          collection workflows and the integration of computational methods with
          qualitative and phenomenological analysis. This interdisciplinary
          position allowed me to bridge technical measurement with critical
          theory, particularly in exploring how algorithmic systems shape
          attention, affect, and un/conscious experience during binge-scrolling.
        </p>

          In parallel with this work, I co-authored a post-modern theoretical
          piece emerging from the project, published in the Italian anarchist
          journal Lo Squaderno. This research ultimately advances a
          phenomenological psycho-politics of scrolling that moves beyond
          technophobic critique to understand social media feeds as affective
          technologies of presence.
