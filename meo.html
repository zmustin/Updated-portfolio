        <p>
          During my contract at <a href="https://meo.ca/"> MEO</a>, I
          collaborated with a multidisciplinary team of data analysts to build a
          <strong>
            first-of-its-kind seedlist of political entities on social media.
          </strong>
          Due to the absence of public APIs and increasing platform-level data
          restrictions, this work relied on creative collection strategies,
          including network-based discovery and manual identification.
          Originally focused on Canadian political actors, the seedlist has
          since expanded to U.S.-based entities, where restricted data access
          has created significant gaps in independent research capacity. The
          seedlist has since enabled numerous published reports and remains
          central to ongoing research on the North American information
          ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also led a mixed-methods analysis of political engagement on
          Bluesky, examining how political entities are using the platform and
          how its communicative dynamics differ from those of established social
          media platforms.
