        Philosophers often fancy themselves godlike— objective watchers
        of the world. I have always rejected this posture, pursued lines of
        inquiry rooted in my own situated experience: the class context in which
        I was raised, the conditions shaping my generation. While I remain
        attentive to the fact that my perspective is necessarily partial and
        biased, I do not see this as a disqualifying feature. On the contrary, I
        take it as the condition of possibility for meaningful philosophical
        work.

        Over several years, I noticed my writing increasingly gravitate towards 
        the digital. 
        <strong>This led me to pursue a degree from McGill University 
            in Computer Science and Philosophy.</strong> I wanted to not only think 
            and write about technology, but participate in it. This reflects me as 
            a person; I’ve never been one to stand by and watch. Throughout my 
            undergraduate degree I’ve sought opportunities at the intersection of 
            programming, digital media, and theoretical inquiry.
        </p>

        Looking ahead, I am particularly interested in developing personal
        projects that pair philosophical writing with tangible, technical
        components. For example, I am currently programming a dummy dating app
        to accompany my recent exploration of dating apps as the paradigmatic
        site of Marx’s commodity fetishism as applied to human relationships.
        Through such work, I aim to think critically <i>with</i> digital systems
        rather than merely <i>about</i> them.
