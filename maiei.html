        <p>
          I joined the
          <a href="https://montrealethics.ai/">Montreal AI Ethics Institute</a>
          without a formal title, motivated by a desire to contribute to an
          organization dedicated to making AI ethics accessible to the public.
          While I initially positioned myself as a general support resource, my
          role quickly crystallized into that of a UX designer. MAIEI already
          produced rigorous, thoughtful content, but in an increasingly crowded
          digital landscape, I recognized that
          <strong>
            how information is presented is just as important as the information
            itself.</strong
          >
          This was a gap I was well positioned to help address.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to redesigning and restructuring key areas of the website,
          I
          <strong
            >developed a taxonomy of article topics and used large language
            models and Hugging Face tools</strong
          >
          to categorize MAIEI’s archive of 900+ articles, validating
          classifications using confidence scores. These changes enabled a
          significantly improved search experience, including topic-based
          browsing. Planned expansions include a chatbot-driven search
          interface, audience-specific content pathways (e.g., “for educators”
          or “for policymakers”), and new community features such as a job board
          and discussion forums.
        </p>
        <p>
          My most significant contribution was the redesign of MAIEI’s flagship
          State of AI Ethics Report. Previous editions were distributed
          primarily as standalone PDFs; for the seventh edition, I
          <strong
            >designed and implemented an interactive, fully navigable web
            experience with an emphasis on accessibility and usability.</strong
          >
          The new format includes structured navigation and a dedicated
          contributors page to highlight the breadth of voices behind the
          report. The response from readers and collaborators has been
          overwhelmingly positive, and I am proud to have helped make critical
          work in AI ethics more accessible to a wider audience.
