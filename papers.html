        <p>
          Over the course of my academic career, my writing has increasingly
          gravitated toward the digital. I engage with topics such as dating
          apps, online information ecosystems, and digital communities and
          subcultures, drawing on theoretical frameworks from thinkers including
          Jean Baudrillard, Susan Sontag, Marshall McLuhan, Simone de Beauvoir,
          Hegel, Marx, Sartre and the like. While this has occasionally involved
          admittedly generous interpretations of essay prompts, I am grateful to
          have built an archive of work that reflects my sustained and evolving
          philosophical orientation toward digital life.

          My paper
          <i
            >Body Projects: The Politics of Gym Culture through a Beauvoirian
            Lens</i
          >
          was published in the Fall 2024 edition of the McGill Journal of Human
          Behaviour. The paper examines the proliferation of contemporary “gym
          culture”, much of it mediated online, and mobilizes Simone de
          Beauvoir’s figure of the narcissist to theorize the affective and
          political dynamics underlying this phenomenon. I am currently in the
          editing stages of publishing other papers.
